# Bank_Check_Extraction

Takes a bank check image and detects 4 objects: check number, date, payee, and amount.

The objects are then extracted as their own individual jpeg files.

These 4 new images will then be inputted into an OCR model to extract the printed and/or
handwritten information from them.
